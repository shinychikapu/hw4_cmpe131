1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
No, increment_int_a doesn't change a after the function call
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
Yes, increment_int_b change b after the function call.
3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
Variable a is not modified because int is immutable object so to modify it you have to use assignment to assign a value. Variable b is a mutable object so a function call can modify it.
